### Hi, I'm Elliott 🤓 <img align="right" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/0DYipdNqJ5n4GYATKL/giphy.gif" width=380px height=330px/>

I've been travelling around the last few years, but I've returned home and landed in front of my computer creating, debugging, and learning all that it takes to become a developer. As a recent Lighthouse Labs alumni I'm eager to find a workplace where I can learn and contribute. 

- 🔭 I’m working on a few projects as seen on my portfolio (elliott2.netlify.app) 
- 🌱 I’m learning computer science basics via Harvard's CS50 and fine tuning my React skills via this Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)
- 🙏 Fun fact: I'm learning Mandarin at the moment
