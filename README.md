### Hi, I'm Elliott 🤓 <img align="right" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/IpeYSEZshTefe/giphy.gif" width=400px height=320px/>

I've been travelling around the last few years, but I've returned home and landed in front of my computer. I've been creating, debugging, and learning all that it takes to become a full stack developer. As a Lighthouse Labs alumni I'm happy to have found a couple places now to refine my skills and put the pedal to metal.
